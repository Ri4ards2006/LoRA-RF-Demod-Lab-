## 🔹 Project Overview

Welcome to **LoRa-RF-Demod-Lab**, my personal lab for **exploring wireless communication, RF signals, and FPGA-based demodulation**.  
The goal is to **learn, experiment, and test demodulation circuits**, integrate antennas, microcontrollers, and sensors, and gradually **develop practical HF knowledge**. In the long term, I aim to **design my own HF PCBs** for signal processing experiments.

The lab is centered around my **Tang Nano 9K FPGA**, chosen for its **high-speed switching capabilities**, which allows real-time signal processing and testing of various **modulation and demodulation techniques**.  

My motivation comes from a growing interest in **communication engineering and high-frequency electronics**, prior training in embedded systems, and exposure to a company working on **real-time demodulation systems**. This repository is designed to combine theory with **hands-on experiments**, improving skills in **electronics, programming, and RF design**.
